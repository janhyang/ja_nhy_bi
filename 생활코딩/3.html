<h2>javascript</h2>


<p> It is a programming language based on Ecma International's
     prototype and is a script language. 
    Except for special purposes, all web browsers have
     a built-in interpreter. Today, it is one 
    of the elements that make up the web, along with HTML and CSS.
     While HTML is responsible for
     the basic structure of the web pag
    e and CSS is responsible for the design, JavaScript is responsible for the 
    operation of the web page on the client side. </p>
